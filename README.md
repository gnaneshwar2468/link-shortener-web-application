#problem statement

A client want  to send test link to there candidates so that they can access test easily,but the problem they facing is the test link can be very long and that became an inconveniences.In order to over come that problem we use a link shortener web application.


#STEP-1
I choosen flask & python language to create a web application.

vs code is used for python programming .

For installing  flask. (pip flask install) usnig anaconda powershall prompt .



#STEP-2

For shortener link i use a pyshortener.

I use a two templates like:HOME ,URLDETAILS

#In home file

In this file i use HTML,CSS for forent end.

It consist of HOME,LOGIN, SIGNUP-styles.

#URLDETAILS

It consist of a body which we place url link.

we place the URL link for shortener.



#STEP-3
The main part is in link.py

where i interated the templates,to make a long URL to a short URL.

I use a demofile,where it store the long URL and shortener URL,instead of creating a database.



#conclusion

By the above process we can make a long link to a shortener link so, we can easily access the link with out any trouble.
